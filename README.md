Advait saravade was given the specifications and requirements by Prof Jitendra Shah.
The initial efforts by M/S Gestell Technologies (Pune)  and supported by Pune LUG were terminated halfway by Gestell Technologies due to their own reasons.
M/S Gestell Technologies had undertaken the job as paid job and they have been paid for their part. The initial version was paid for by M/S Sundaram Multi-Pap and hence has been uploaded on Google App Store by them.

Advait Saravade has developed the source code from the scratch and is taking the same forward beyond functions from where earlier version stopped.
